## 7. Mutual Reference

### Key questions and answers

Describe what is a mutual reference?

- one function needed for operating on an element and one on the list

What are Arbitrary-arity trees?

What is backtracking search?

## 8a. Two One-of Types

Learn to design a functions that consume two arguments which are one-of types.
In order to do this, we learn to develop a new model of our code, the cross product of
the types comment table.

Cross product provides us with a way to clearly think of all possible test cases. It will
then help us get a basis for what our functions body will look like and it helps to simplify
the function when there are equal answers in some cells.

The type comments predict the templates.
By using a cross product of type comments table, we are simplifying at **model level**.

That simplification helps us reason about the code even before we start writing it. This is what
good engineers are able to do.

## 8b. Local

Technique for improving the strucutre of code. Good programmers take time to improve the structure of their code once it is written.

We'll learn local expressions which are new kind of expressions that makes it possible to write definitions that are only visible withing the local expression.

### Learning goals

- Be able to write well-formed local expressions.
- Be able to diagram lexical scoping on top of expressions using local.
- Be able to hand-evaluate local expressions.
- Be able to use local to encapsulate function definitions.
- Be able to use local to avoid redundant computation.
