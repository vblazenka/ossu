# 1a. Beginning Student Language

In this part of the course instructor is showing us the [BSL language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/beginner.html) that is evaluated using the [Racket IDE](https://racket-lang.org/).

## Notes
- BSL has an easy syntaxt and since I have programming experience following this course for now it is really easy.
