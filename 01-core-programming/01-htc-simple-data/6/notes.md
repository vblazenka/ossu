# Binary Search Trees

In this module we will investigate how the structure of data affects performances, especially the lookup time in a large data store.

BST = new self-referential form of data

## Learning Goals
- reason about the time required to search data
- identify problem domain information that should be represented using BSTs
- check wheter a given tree conforms to the BTS invariants
