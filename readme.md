# Introduction

The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements. The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc...

## Core CS

### Core programming
**Topics covered**:
`functional programming`
`design for testing`
`program requirements`
`common design patterns`
`unit testing`
`object-oriented design`
`static typing`
`dynamic typing`
`ML-family languages (via Standard ML)`
`Lisp-family languages (via Racket)`
`Ruby`
`and more`

The How to Code courses are based on the textbook [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2003-09-26/). The First Edition is available for free online and includes problem sets and solutions. Students are encouraged to do these assignments.
