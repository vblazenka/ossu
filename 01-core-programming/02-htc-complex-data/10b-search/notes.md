# 10b - Search

Expand generative recursion and work on search problems. Search problems belong to category of problem solving
that can be solved by generating the space of all possible paths from a given state and traversing that space
until a solution is found.

## Learning goals
- Identify whether a function should be designed using domain knowledge, structural recursion, built-in abstract list functions or generative recursion.
- design a backtrackign generative search
